\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Routing in wireless ad hoc networks} presents significant challenges due to the dynamic nature of nodes and the absence of centralized control. This study investigates the performance of the \textbf{Link Reversal Algorithm} (LRA\cite{gafni1981distributed}) in a simulated environment using the\textbf{ ns-3 network simulator}. The simulation parameters include varying node densities and network area sizes, with a focus on packet loss rates. The results provide insights into the \textbf{scalability} and robustness of LRA in different network conditions. The context of this work is \textbf{disaster recovery scenarios} where traditional communication infrastructure, such as cellular antennas, is unavailable, and a peer-to-peer (P2P) network is used for communication.
