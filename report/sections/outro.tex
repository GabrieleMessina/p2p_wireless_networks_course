\section{Conclusion}
The simulation-based \textbf{analysis} of the \textbf{LRA routing protocol} provides valuable insights into its performance in varying network scenarios. The results suggest that while LRA is \textbf{effective in small to medium sized networks}, its \textbf{efficiency declines} as network \textbf{area increases}, primarily due to nodes reachability, congestion and mobility-induced route fluctuations. 

Future work could explore \textbf{optimizations} to LRA, such as \textbf{adaptive routing} strategies and \textbf{congestion control} mechanisms, to enhance its scalability and reliability in large-scale ad hoc networks. Additionally, the focus on \textbf{disaster recovery} scenarios highlights the importance of \textbf{robust ad hoc communication} protocols in emergency response efforts, where traditional infrastructure is unavailable, and reliable peer-to-peer communication \textbf{is vital}.
